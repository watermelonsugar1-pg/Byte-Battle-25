# This is the README for Team Heckers, as part of the ByteBattle Hackathon 2025!

## Overview
Our project focuses on the theme of AI for Social Good. We created an engaging and educational game that highlights how responsible AI can be used to protect individuals and promote digital safety.

## Gamefied Concept
In our game, players control a Good AI Robot, designed to safeguard society. Its mission is to track down and defeat a Bad AI Robot that has been engaging in harmful activities like scamming users, stealing personal information, and misusing technology.

The gameplay revolves around:
* Combat Mechanics - The good AI trying to destory the bad AI bot.
* Awareness - The game tries to subtly teach players about online safety, data privacy, and the impact of malicious AI.

## Purpose
This project aims to:
* Demonstrate how AI can be used to promote safety, trust, and positive impact in a gamefied version.
* Deliver an enjoyable game experience while spreading an important social message.

## Tech Stack
In our repository we have the game which is made in Godot, and also the website which is made using HTML, CSS and JS.
Note: We have used AI to change the CSS elements and try to beautify the website.
